              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Ease of use</strong> – The contracts are fully customisable, and can be signed over the Internet, between any parties from around the world</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>New standard</strong> – We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)" alt="Blockchain technology on Wikipedia" target="_blank">Blockchain Technology</a>, originally implemented in 2009 with bitcoin, and currently used for various types of records, be it data or programs, e.g. currency and contracts, respectively</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Safety</strong> – The records on blockchain, e.g. contracts, are by definition secure from tampering and revision. Every node, e.g. user, has a copy of the blockchain, and can assess it's validity. Every node is trusted, or not, using the same rules. The records can be open or private.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><strong>Decentralised</strong> – There are no central entities or authorities, nor a central copy of the blockchain. The nodes in a blockchain form a network, which can be accessed via Internet, or other forms of networking. The users are location independent.</p>

                <div class="mc-blog__body">
                  <p><strong>We are happy to announce our first product – the Global 401K Retirement Plans.</strong></p>
                  <p>Why Retirement Plans on Blockchain?</p>
                  <p>People across the globe are becoming wealthier and living longer, as globalization and trade continue to raise the standard of living for all. It is in this backdrop of the rise in global wealth, and the creation of a global middle class, that we hope to propose a global 401k. Often, people in poorer countries do not have the same luxuries or access to retirement and savings account as people in richer countries. Furthermore, pensions & employer-funded retirement accounts are in retreat, moving to a defined contribution model, where the employer simply provides you the money up front, in the form of matching what you put in, leaving the responsibility of investing and maintaining that account on the individual employee.</p>
                  <p>Even more so, the available information on financial planning is sparse, globally. Deciding on a retirement plan can be overwhelming, with financial predators at every turn, offering their services to take your money and manage it for you. However, the catch is the fees that they take, despite often making no better predictions than the market itself.</p>
                  <p><strong>The global 401k, as we envision it:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Anyone in the world has access to it by funding it with their local currency</li>
                    <li>Each individual will have direct ownership of their account</li>
                    <li>Each individual can add, change, or withdraw their money at anytime, back into a currency of their choice</li>
